These pices of code are part of the course [Comparative Programming Languages](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H0S01AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp34784) at *KU Leuven*.

I took the original code provided by Professor [Frank Piessens](http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00018905) and then I did the modification according with the exercise describe in the book [Essentials of Programming Languages: 3rd edition](http://www.eopl3.com/).

Inside the code you can find ccomments about the modifications of the original code and the number exercise. For further explanation of the problem statment refer to the book above describe.
